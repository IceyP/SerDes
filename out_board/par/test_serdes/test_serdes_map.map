WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net icon_control0<13> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2381 - Issue with pin connections and/or configuration
   on block:<u0_common_block/gtxe2_common_lane1_i>:<GTXE2_COMMON_GTXE2_COMMON>. 
   The output clock pins QPLLOUTCLK and QPLLOUTREFCLK should be connected
   (unless this is just for access to the DRP).

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
