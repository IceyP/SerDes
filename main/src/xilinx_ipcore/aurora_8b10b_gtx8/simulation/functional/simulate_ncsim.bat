REM  SIMULATE_NCSIM.BAT
REM
REM
REM  Description: A .bat file to run a simulation using the aurora_8b10b_gtx8_exdes module,
REM               an example design which instantiates aurora_8b10b_gtx8.
REM
REM               Ensure the follwoing:
REM               The library paths for UNISIMS_VER, SIMPRIMS_VER, XILINXCORELIB_VER,
REM               UNISIM, SIMPRIM, XILINXCORELIB are set correctly in the cds.lib and
REM               hdl.var files.
REM               Variables LMC_HOME and XILINX are set
REM               Define the mapping for the work library in cds.lib file.
